## What is Sepolia Faucet?
<br>

The Sepolia Testnet is currently the most important testnet of the Ethereum Mainnet. Sepolia is primarily used by blockchain developers to test various applications. While ETH is the native cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain, Sepolia ETH is the native token for the Sepolia Testnet. What needs to be emphasized is that Sepolia ETH has only usage value and no real economic value.

In order to get free Sepolia ETH, you need to use ETH testnet faucets. You can easily find many free Sepolia Faucets nowadays. To prevent bots and abuse, nearly all platforms have taken countermeasures by restricting users to claim only a small number of ETH test tokens for a limited period of time.

In most cases, the free Sepolia faucets will suffice for a developer's testing needs, but if you need more Sepolia ETH, you can also pay a small fee to buy some Sepolia ETH.

I will introduce some safe and reliable free Sepolia ETH faucets and Sepolia ETH sellers.

## Sepolia ETH Free Faucets
<br>

I've compiled a list of the most popular free Sepolia faucets, all of which are commonly used by myself and are guaranteed to be safe and secure (**please be careful not to give out your private key or mnemonic anywhere**).

Most of them only require users to complete registration and you can fill in your wallet address to receive Sepolia ETH. Only a few platforms will check if your wallet address has at least 0.001 ETH balance or enough ETH mainnet transactions.

## L2 Sepolia ETH Free Faucet

<br>

In addition to getting Sepolia ETH directly from Sepolia Testnet faucets, most people ignore that we can also use L2 faucets. Compared to Sepolia Faucets, which are in short supply, L2 Sepolia ETH faucets have less restrictions and usually send more tokens to developers.

However, Sepolia ETH you claimed on L2 chains needs to be sent to Sepolia Testnet if you want to test apps on it. You can use the bridge to send Sepolia ETH from one network to another.

The platforms introduced above (such as Alchemy, Quicknode) all provide L2 faucets, you can pick anyone you like to claim Sepolia ETH. I'll just simply make a list of some L2 faucets commonly used.
